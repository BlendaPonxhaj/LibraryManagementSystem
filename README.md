# ðŸ“š Library Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Library Management System is a simple C++ project, designed to manage library resources
efficiently. It allows users to store, borrow and manage books. This system is simple but very
effective for small-scalelibrary management and serves as a great introduction to file handling in C++.
This project doesn't rely on databases.

## GitHub Workflow & Team Collaboration

This project allows a **collaborative development approach** using **GitHub**, allowing multiple team members
to work together.
Key aspects include:
- **Branches:** Different features are developed in seperate branches before merging into the main branch.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Each change is reviewed through pull requests, ensuring code quality and reducing errors before merging.
- **Version Control:** GitHub allows tracking all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Team Work:** Developers work on different modules, coordinate changes and contribute to a well-structured and maintainable system.
